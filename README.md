Online Food Ordering System

# ----Abstract----

ONLINE FOOD ORDER SYSTEM is a website designed primarily for use in the food delivery industry. The system also allows to quickly and easily manage an online menu which customers can browse and use to place orders with just few clicks. Restaurant employees then use these orders through an easy to navigate graphical interface for efficient processing.
Introduction:
Online ordering system that I am proposing here, greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. System presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in an easy to use manner. Admin can manage all the restaurants from the dash board and change status of the orders. Customers can choose food Items of their choice and order them. Customer can view order history, and can check status of the order. If order is Accepted/Rejected/Out for Delivery etc. Once the order is placed it is entered in the database and retrieved in pretty much real time.
